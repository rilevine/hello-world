Testing
My name is Rivkah, and I am a Data Analysis/Business Development Intern at Methods Consultants of Ann Arbor. I'm learning how to use Github. I know this will be a useful tool not only for this internship, but for future classes, internships, jobs, academic endeavours, etc. As a data analyst/statistician, coding will be invaluable to my ability to learn about and use statistics. I'm excited!
